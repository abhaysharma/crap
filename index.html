          <h3>Summary (for Hiring Committee)</h3>
          <p>I am using teh BOPPPS template for the lesson plan in this micro-teach. The BOPPPS template contains Bridge-in, Objective, Pre-assessment, Participatory Learning, Post-assessment and Summary. In my experience BOPPPS works best for lessons covering theory for the hands on topics. BOPPPS helps an me to gauge learner's progress from what they already knew to what they have learnt and retained.</p>

        <h3>Assignment Requirements</h3>
        Write a report analyzing any one design piece based on the C.R.A.P. principles. You may choose good or bad design to discuss what you like or dislike in the design, your experience of the design, and what can be done to improve the design. The designed piece could be a poster, website, an article or promotional material.
        Include a link to the website site or a picture of the article or other printed material that you are analyzing.

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        Submit a PDF of your report through Brightspace before the start of next class. March 29th, 2021 at 1 pm.

        <h2>Lesson Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Is graphic Design all conceptual? A general misconception is that graphic design is all conceptual but, the truth is, there is a method to it as well. The two most important parts to consider in a graphic design method are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements</li>
          <li>Principles</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <h4>Elements</h4>
          <p>Elements are the basic units that make up a visual piece.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Line</li>
            <li>Shape</li>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Texture</li>
            <li>Space</li>
            <li>Form</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Principles</h4>
          <p>Principles are applied to the elements to define good or bad design. They give us rules that guide our design, such as using proper contrast, repeating styles for consistency, adding white space etc.</p>
          <p>There are different principles and concepts used in the graphic design industry but the one on which most designers agree is C.R.A.P. design principle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="objective">
          <h3>Objective <i class="im im-target"></i></h3>
          <p>The objective for this lecture is to learn about C.R.A.P. design principle and be able to identify components of C.R.A.P. in a design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pre-asses">
          <h3>Pre-assessment</h3>
          <p>Let's look at some examples to see our perception of design.</p>
          <div>
            <h4>Example 1</h4>
            <p>In this example we can notice that design B has the company name in larger font, which makes it stand out on the page, easy to read, and gives it importance from the rest of the text.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-1.png" alt="image with two examples one with company name larger">
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Example 2</h4>
            <p>In this case we can notice that example B has a repetition of style, the green colour is repeated for the title of each piece of contact. Creating a visual connection between the three pieces of information.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-2.png" alt="image with two examples one with title of contact information in different colour">
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Example 3</h4>
            <p>This this third example the scenario B has the text aligned to the left of the container box. This makes it easy for us to read the information and the design looks cleaner than the center aligned text.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-3.png" alt="image with two examples one with the text aligned to the left">
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Example 4</h4>
            <p>This final example shows how adding some space between different type of content helps with grouping the content in a design yet keeping it as one cohesive piece.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-4.png" alt="image with two examples one with space between company name and contact information">
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>As we can see from this summary image, how our design progressed from random text, hard to read and comprehend to a semi-decent business card. In each step we have added one of the components of C.R.A.P. design principle.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-5.png" alt="image with all the previous examples combined">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="crap">
          <h3>What is C.R.A.P.?</h3>
          <p>C.R.A.P. is a widely used design principle which stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. Let's discuss each one of the components of C.R.A.P. in detail.</p>
          <div>
            <h4>Contrast</h4>
            <p>Visual Difference in color, size or shape of an element from its surrounding.</p>
            <p>The first example that we saw in our pre-assessment was showing a contrast of font size used for the company name.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-1.png" alt="image with two examples one with company name larger">
            <div>
              <p>Here is another example of contrast in case of a book's contents page. Just by increasing the font size of the title and thickness of each of the main topic headings makes the contents list easier to read.</p>
              <img src="images/part-1.png" alt="image with two examples with difference of contrast">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Repetition</h4>
            <p>Reoccurring of the same element or matching properties of different elements.</p>
            <p>In our pre-assessment we saw the repetition of green colour for the titles of each contact information.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-2.png" alt="image with two examples one with title of contact information in different colour">
            <div>
              <p>Following with the contents page example we can see the repetition of the style for each first letter of the main topic.</p>
              <img src="images/part-2.png" alt="image with two examples with repeating style">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Alignment</h4>
            <p>Alignment of elements with respect to a common line of object.</p>
            <p>Reflecting back to the pre-assessment example, the text in our design was left alined to the box making it look cleaner.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-3.png" alt="image with two examples one with the text aligned to the left">
            <p>In case of the contents page example we can see that by indenting the sub-topic list it is easier to identify the main and sub topics of the book.</p>
            <img src="images/part-3.png" alt="image with example of alignment of sub-topics indented under the main topic">
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Proximity</h4>
            <p>Decreasing or increasing the distance between elements for grouping or separating them based on their relation.</p>
            <p>In out pre-assessment we used proximity by adding space between the company name and teh contact information. this helped in grouping related content together.</p>
            <img src="images/pre-slide-4.png" alt="image with two examples one with space between company name and contact information">
            <div>
              <p>In the example of the book content page, we have added space between the title of each chapter to group teh chapter and sub-chapters together.</p>
              <img src="images/part-4.png" alt="image with space between groups of chapter">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The design principle of C.R.A.P. means Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. C.R.A.P. helps us to define rules which govern our design and helps differentiate between good and bad designs.</p>
